Home for all my projects

This website was originally created in 2023 as a way to try out GitHub Pages. It was only shown as "under construction" for quite some time, though.

When I heard about Hack Club, I saw it as an opportunity to finally finish this project.

This website now includes my projects and some more information about me, as well as my social links.
It may include more information about which tools I use and which languages I know in the future.

This website was also my first time using Tailwind CSS. It was a great experience and I'll definitely use it in the future.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the website!
